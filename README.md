Application Name: Overwatch Stats and Friends

Github: https://github.com/deccakray/OWSTATS

## Synopsis

The objective for this application is to retrieve stats for the video game, Overwatch, where a user can search for any player's profile (Battle.net Account) for statistics on Overwatch. For example, the user will see their level, wins, losses, how many games they played, average eliminations, their skill rating, etc. 

Our idea of how the application should work: The user would type their username in an EditText and the user will press a Button that will tell the application to use the entered name and search it by using OWAPI API Docs (Overwatch API API Docs). We request the data (the statistics) from the server, and then the application will display the data for the user on a different activity.

Furthermore, the application will be able to take the username input and use it was a name for the chatroom.

## Motivation

The team members are active players of the game, Overwatch. We thought it would be a fun and interesting project to have an application that can fetch and display statstical data on an Android platform. The user can check their stats without needing to open a browser to save computer resources. We also thought it would be a nice feature to have a chat room where Overwatch players can commmunicate with each other.

## Notes
#### Research
A few hours were spent on researching on how to use github, like how to retrieve and update the code repository by using the command prompt or some of us using GitHub Desktop. This is new for some of us as we havenâ€™t done group projects like this in depth. How to send a GET request to the server was something else that needed to be researched.

A numbers of hours spent researching the OWAPI API Docs that we are using to fetch data from. Also researching Firebase for the Chat messaging feature of our application. 

#### Challenges
Connection to databse, UI, chat messaging

#### Debugging Issues
